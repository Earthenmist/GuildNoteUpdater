📜 Changelog – Version 1.2.1  
  
📅 Release Date: 14-01-2026  
🎯 Expansion: The War Within / Midnight Pre-Patch  
  
🛠️ Changes & Improvements  
🔒 Guild Membership Enforcement  
  
Auto-Update now requires guild membership  
The Enable Auto-Update option is automatically disabled when the player is not in a guild.  
If Auto-Update was previously enabled, it will be forced OFF immediately upon leaving a guild.  
The Run Now button is also disabled while unguilded to prevent invalid executions.  
Settings update live when joining or leaving a guild (no reload required).  
  
🧠 Smart UI Behaviour  
  
Auto-Update checkbox is visually greyed out and relabelled to indicate a guild requirement.  
Settings panel continuously validates guild state to prevent manual re-enabling while unguilded.  
  
🛡️ Safety & Consistency  
  
Auto-update logic now includes a hard guild check to prevent background runs without a guild.  
Slash command /gnotes auto will no longer enable auto-update while unguilded.  
  
⚠️ Notes  
  
Fully compatible with Midnight / Interface 12.0.x  
No data loss — existing settings are preserved and restored once you rejoin a guild.
