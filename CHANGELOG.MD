📜 Changelog – Version 1.20-Beta  
  
📅 Release Date: 12-11-2025  
  
🛠️ Changes & Improvements  
  
✅ Added Run Now button to manually trigger guild note updates from the settings panel.  
✅ Added Show Minimap Button checkbox in settings for easier control (no need for slash commands).  
✅ Fixed Lua error when using the minimap toggle if LibDBIcon is missing (now safely handled).  
✅ Improved startup logic for Midnight Beta builds — now works even when libraries load differently.  
✅ Settings panel and slash commands now use consistent feedback messages.  
✅ General stability and compatibility improvements for Midnight Beta clients.  
  
⚠️ Known Issues / Notes  
  
🔸 The minimap icon option will be disabled automatically if the LibDBIcon library is not available on your client.  
🔸 Auto-update remains paused inside instances by default; manual runs are not allowed there.  
🔸 Future versions will introduce localization support and further Midnight UI refinements.
